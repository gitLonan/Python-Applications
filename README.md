5. **Change Location**  
On the picture you can see you have two input fields to fill, first one is *location*, it can be city, region, small city, any place you want and if the OpenWeather database doesn't have anything with said name it will create a **pop up** and tell you.(check if you typed the name correctly, just google it). Second one is *alpha 2 code*, every country is represented by a code, and it is a string of lenght two, just scroll and find your country, they are orderd alphabeticaly.

6. **How to change between said features**  
Just right click, since PySimpleGui has it's own limits, for some parts of the screen it won't work, thats because padding for the text creates unclickable 'zones', soo just try somewhere else.

## Getting Started
-Before you get all hyped up about this app first you gotta **register** at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). By doing soo you will get your own **API key** which you'll be able to make all the needed API calls from the server.  
-Then you will need to copy the said key from their site and paste it in `user_class.py` in variable: **`key`**
